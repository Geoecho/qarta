# 🔄 How Vercel Updates Your Site

**Good News:** You don't need to do anything manually!
Since you connected your GitHub repository to Vercel, the update happens **automatically**.

1.  **You Push to GitHub** (You just did this via `git push`).
2.  **Vercel Sees the Push** immediately.
3.  **Vercel Builds & Deploys** the new code.

---

## How to Check Progress

1.  Go to your **[Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)**.
2.  Click on your project (`qarta`).
3.  Look at the **"Deployments"** tab.
4.  You should see a **"Building..."** (Yellow) or **"Ready"** (Green) status for your latest commit: `Switch to Edge Only Ticket Mode`.

*   **Yellow**: Wait ~1 minute.
*   **Green**: Your site `qarta.xyz` is now live with the new changes!

## If it didn't start automatically:
(Rare case)
1.  In Vercel, go to **Deployments**.
2.  Click the **three dots (...)** next to your latest deployment or the "Redeploy" button if available.
3.  Or verify that your Git Integration is connected in **Settings > Git**.
